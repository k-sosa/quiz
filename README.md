# quiz
// This was the fourth homework of the course and it was the most challenging so far. I had a hard time creating dynamic elements to put my questions and answers. After my tutor showed me how to create the dynamic elements in html I was able to have my questions and answers populate and I also had a timer going.

// My thought process was that if the user didnt pick anything I still needed the questions to keep going, so my tutor suggested I make a function to change the question every 15 seconds. Which does happen if I run my code, but then my timer does not stop, it keeps going to negative numbers. 

//When my timer got to 0 is was supposed to hide the quiz and display the score board and textbox for the user to put their initials and that does not happen because my timer does not stop. Ever.
